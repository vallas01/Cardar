# Cardar

Cardar is an app that allow users to interact with the website by creating, searching, editing, and deleting a post. The app gives users the opportunity to edit their own profile such as their bio, location, etc. Additionally, users are able to interact with other users in the community by creating and reading comments, as well as edit and delete their own personal comments. The home page allows users to see some of the most recent posts that were uploaded to the website.

# Features
## User Profile
Users are able to view and customize their profile dynamically if they decide the information they provided in the registration does not match with their current status (location, bio, etc).

## Car Posts
The Cardar experience permits users to Create, Read, Update, or Delete their posts.

### Create
To create a post, a user can simply click on the 'plus' icon in the navigation bar no matter what route they are in while navigating through the app. Once the icon is clicked, it will take the user to a form that will ask them for specific information about the post. Once the form is correctly filled out, they will be redirected to their profile with the newly added post.

### Read
The user will be able to access any post in several ways. We encourage users to utilize the search bar to find a specific car that they might be interested in (more info on this under the Search Feature section). A user can also access car posts from a user's profile and on the home page with posts that were recently populated to the app.

### Update
When looking through their own posts, users will be able to dynamically edit posts that they have created to fix one, many, or all fields of the post. To update, click on the 'edit' button and make the necessary changes. Once the form is correctly filled out, the user can press the 'Submit' button to update the changes. The user will receive errors if the form is filled out incorrectly.

### Delete
Similar to the Update Feature, users are able to dynamically delete their own posts by clicking the 'edit' button. A 'Delete' button will appear and can be clicked on if the user decides to delete the specified car post.

## Search
The search feature gives users a way to search for any car under several fields of the car post. With the search bar in the navigation bar, users will have immediate access to search for any post they might be interested in. When an input is provided and submitted, the server will search for the key word under the following categories: model, make, and color. A successful match will display the images of the car posts. If the server cannot find anything in the mentioned fields with the specified key word, no posts will appear.
